# Flow – Retail / Walk-in sale (Menudeo)

## Story (how it happens)
A customer arrives, is attended at production, and the operator needs to generate a note quickly.

## Steps (realistic)
1. Attendant confirms availability visually.
2. Operator creates a Sales Note:
   - Customer = “Public / Walk-in” OR quick-add name
3. Add line items, adjust price as needed.
4. Record payment (cash/transfer).
5. Print or share the note.

## System requirements
- No forced customer details beyond name
- Inline product add/search
- Price editable per line
