# 60 – MVP Scope (Recommended)

## Phase 1 (must ship)
1. Sales Notes (fast entry + editable) with folio `YYYY-MM-NN`
2. Parties quick-add (name only) + “PÚBLICO” walk-in Party
3. Product variants quick-add
4. Payments: Cash/Transfer/Credit/Al cambio
5. Reports: weekly/monthly by date range + export to Excel
6. Draft/autosave + restore (slow internet resilience)

## Phase 2
- Party Statement screen (Nos debe / Le debemos / Neto) + movement history (if not in MVP)
- Supplier purchases (A/P) with supplier folio reference + payments/discount adjustments
- Accounts Receivable dashboard (if not satisfied by statement)
- Quotations with conversion to Sales Notes
- Annual “by product” report
- Basic audit trail

## Out of scope (initially)
- Full inventory management with accurate stock counts
- Multi-warehouse, multi-branch, multi-tenant
- Complex accounting module
