# Business Rule – Editable prices

## Why
Plant price varies by appearance/quality and needs to be adjusted during the sale.

## Rule
- Each Sales Note line item has:
  - Default price (from catalog)
  - Final price (editable)
- Price editing permissions:
  - Operators can edit final price (MVP) OR
  - Admin approval required (phase 2)

## Reporting
Reports use the **final price** recorded in the Sales Note line.
