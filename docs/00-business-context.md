# 00 – Business Context (Los Laureles)

## Snapshot
- **Workforce**: ~10 people total; only ~3 regularly use a computer/phone for operations (sales notes, collections, quotations, invoices, admin tasks).
- **Customers**: ~30 regular customers per month + walk-in retail.
- **Sales profile**: Mostly **wholesale** and **shipments** (out-of-state).
- **Peak season**: January–February.
- **Catalog size**: ~50 species; variations (bag size, color, presentation/quality) can lead to ~200 sellable combinations.

## Operational reality
- When a customer arrives, sales are handled quickly and informally.
- **Availability** is usually checked visually in production (not via system).
- **Prices vary** depending on the plant’s appearance/quality; the owner sets the base but the seller needs to edit price at the time of sale.
- Sales are currently recorded in **Excel** and memory/experience.

## Constraints
- Internet can be **slow**; additional steps and multiple forms kill adoption.
- Power outages can happen; losing in-progress work is a major risk.
- The system must allow:
  - Minimal required data
  - Fast entry
  - Inline edits
  - Draft/autosave + recovery

## Stakeholders
- **Juan**: owner; likely system administrator.
- **Paty**: main secretary; core operator (sales, collections, quotations, invoices).
- **Sheila**: another secretary/operator.
- **Nancy**: production; often the first person who attends buyers at the plant area.
